# Chat-Application-Challenge
Coding Challenge to create a chat application using ASP.NET MVC and RabbitMQ

It has some unit testing methods to test the BOT

It's been done in 2 days so I haven't had time to add all the bonus features, but I have added

* Have more than one chatroom
* Handle messages that are not understood


All mandatory features have been implemented

To test in 2 or more windows please use different browsers and/or incognito mode to avoid session sharing.

Please check the Wiki for more information
